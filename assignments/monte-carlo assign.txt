You are a tv gameshow player.

In this game show there is a car to be won, but there are also goats to be won, the game show host hides these goats and one car behind three doors and asks you to make a choice.

The second part of the process is a part where the game show host removes one goat/ wrong answer from the remainder and asks you if you would like to switch your selection or remain with the chosen option.

Q: Should you switch or should you hold on to your original choice. Write a small program to show the probability of winning for if you switch or if you hold.
